"person_id", "treatment", "ohp_all_ever_survey", "age_inp",            "dia_dx_pre_lottery", "edu_inp", "gender_inp",            "hbp_dx_pre_lottery", "race_white_inp", "bp_sar_inp", "chl_inp", "dia_dx_post_lottery",            "doc_num_mod_inp", "hbp_dx_post_lottery"

The treatment variable is treatment rather than ohp_all_ever_survey because the treatment is being given access to healthcare, not exactly receiving healthcare.

Treatment indicates whether the person won the lottery that gave them access to healthcare. Ohp_all_ever_survey indicates if the individual ever signed up for Medicaid healthcare. Not all lottery winners (i.e., the treated) will follow through with signing up for Medicaid. Additionally, some in the control group in any experiment may find a way to access a service that is supposed to be administered by treatment status.
